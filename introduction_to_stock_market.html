            <dd>The term stock market refers as a network of stock exchanges where traders and investors
                buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. Such financial activties are conducted through formal
                exchanges that
                operates under a defined set of regulations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Private companies list shares of their stocks through initial public offering (IPO) process. Investors
                purchases listed shares which helps the company to raise money to grow its business. When the company is
                listed on a stock exchange it becomes public company and investor can bus and sell the company's shares.
                <br>
                <br>
                Traders who are part of stock market can buy or sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that
                are part of the stock market.
            </dd>
            <dt id="topic_2">How does the Stock Market Works?</dt>
            <dd>
                By selling shares of stock, the stock market helps companies to raise money to fund ther operations.
                Companies get access to the capital which they need to operate and expand their businesses without
                having to take on debt by listing their shares for sale on the stock exchanges.
                <br>
                <br>
                Investor are taking benefit by exchanging their money for shares and they gain the benefits as their
                shares of stock become more valuable over time when companies grow and expand their businesses.
            </dd>
            <dt id="topic_3">What time do stock markets open?</dt>
            <dd>
                For major stock markets such as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and
                the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq), regular trading hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET, Monday to Friday,
                except on statutory holidays, in which case the respective market would not be open – e.g., on Labour
                Day, the US and Canadian stock markets are not open. North American trading is generally based on the
                Eastern
                Time Zone irrespective of where the exchange is located. Any trades that are entered with an online
                brokerage
                outside of regular trading hours are executed when markets open, unless otherwise indicated.
                <br>
                <br>
                Investors may face lower risk if they execute their trades during regular market hours. This is because
                prices in pre-market trading tend to be more volatile with higher potential bid-ask spreads. Most people
                place trades during regular market hours, which can create more supply or demand of specific securities
                and influence the price.

                The most obvious reason to consider investing in the stock market is to help grow your money over time.
                You’re also supporting other companies to grow and supporting the economy as a whole.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although it takes time to understand the stock market and how it works, once you do, technology has made
                it easy to be involved with your own financial portfolio. By investing, you can also increase your
                financial literacy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Of course, there are risks associated with investing in the stock market. You do need to educate
                yourself and invest wisely.
