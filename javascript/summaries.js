    The capitalist system is the foundation of many contemporary economies throughout the world. Private 
    property, private control of the means of production, capital accumulation, and competition are some 
    of the most crucial elements of a capitalist society. Simply put, in markets where capital goods are 
    owned by both enterprises and private persons, market forces govern capitalist systems. This stands 
    in stark contrast to communism, which is a government-run, classless system. But what are some of capitalism's 
    main characteristics? Here, we discuss some of the key characteristics of a capitalist economy. The purest 
    form of capitalism is free market or laissez-faire. Private people have no restrictions in this kind of 
    economic organisation. They can choose what to make or sell, where to invest their money, and how much to 
    charge for their goods and services when trading them on the open market. The laissez-faire system functions
     freely in the absence of checks and constraints. This book is all you need to understand capitalism.`;

    What does the term "entrepreneurial" mean? It involves more than just founding a firm or creating a spinoff
    from research. It's a manner of thinking or a mindset. Simply put, entrepreneurs think and act differently.
    The keyword "intrapreneurial" highlights the desire of businesses to have adaptable, flexible staff who
    can think for themselves, proving that you can be entrepreneurial even if you work for someone else.
    Knowing your sector inside and out and being able to take advantage of that knowledge to open up new 
    chances can be considered entrepreneurial. Entrepreneurship can entail freely exchanging ideas and recognising 
    perceived setbacks as opportunities for learning and development. Simply stepping outside of the box and being
    prepared for the unexpected can be considered entrepreneurial. The hard-core serial entrepreneur who has developed
    a variety of company ideas, the social entrepreneur who uses technology to empower women, or artists who use 
    their work to bring attention to social injustice or unfairness are all examples of entrepreneurial thought 
    in action. This book is all you need to bring your idea / business to life.`;

    document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `<b>MONEYFESTO by KELLY LOUIS MILLER</b><br>
    Making a plan for your future, specifically one that addresses how you will handle your finances and be ready 
    for any potential expenses and problems, is known as financial planning. The procedure entails assessing your 
    existing financial condition, determining your goals, generating and putting into practice pertinent advice. 
    Financial planning can include a wide range of services, which we outline below. It is comprehensive and 
    all-encompassing. Instead than concentrating on just one area of your money, it sees clients as actual individuals 
    with a range of objectives and duties. After that, it discusses a number of financial realities to determine how 
    to help individuals live their lives to the fullest. Asset management and financial planning are not the same 
    things. Managing investments on behalf of a client is referred to as asset management. Choosing the stocks, 
    bonds, mutual funds, and other investments a client should make are included in this. This book will help you in 
    creating a financial plan with a complete overview of the steps youâ€™ll have to take to achieve the goals you lay
    out for yourself.`;
