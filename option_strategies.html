            <h3>What is stock or shares?</h3>
            <p>Stock or shares means we are actually buying a piece of company.
                For example-If a company only had 100 shares of stock and we bought one share of that
                company we would literally own 1 percent of that company.

            <h3>What is an Option?</h3>
            <p>An Option is just a contract between two parties.There is a buyer for an option as well
                there's a seller of an option.We can be a buyer or a seller.We can take either of the side.
                It means one person is betting when the stock price is going up and one person when they make this
                contract betting the stock price is going down.In Options, there are something called a leveraged
                product.

            <h3>Charcterstics Of Options</h3>
            <h4>1) 1 Option = "Equals" 100 shares of stock.</h4>
            <p>For example - If we use priceline as our stock.Then the last price on which priceline traded
                is at $1174.17 cents.We are buying one share of priceline stock and that will cost us
                $1174.17 cents. In this case, the price would be $117417.00 ($1174.17 * 100 = $117417.00).
                One Option actually controls this much priceline stock.
            </p>
            <h4>2) Expire on the 3rd Friday Of Month</h4>
            <p>Option expires on 3rd Friday of Month in which your option is in and includes standard
                expiration cycles.There are different expiration cycles like weekly cycle ('w'),
                quaterly cycle ('Q').
            </p>
            <h4>3) Multiple Timeframes</h4>
            <p>There are multi timeframes for options. then we can buy stock its one time frame, it never
                expires.We buy a stock and we own it for as long as we want to own it.Options have expiration
                as there are multiple time frames as in months and not every month has to be there.
            </p>
            <h4>4) Option = Multiple "Strike Prices"</h4>
            <p>There are multiple strike prices inside each month's option what they call chain.</p>
            <h4>5) Bid - Ask Spread</h4>
            <p>Bid means sell it now price as well as the low price.Ask is buy it now price and the high price
                We always want to buy or sell it at the mid-price which is the most fair price.Further, we have
                to choose an up or down direction options that have directional component.

            <h3>Kinds of Options</h3>
            <p>There are only two kinds of Options-</p>
            <section>
                <h4 id="call-option">A) Calls Options</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy
                        the underlying security at the strike price on or before expiration.
                    </li>
                    <li>A long call can be used to speculate on the price of the underlying rising, since it has
                        unlimited upside potential but
                        the maximum loss is the premium (price) paid for the option.</li>
                    <li>We buy calls if stock is going up.</li>
                    <li>We sell calls if stock is going down.</li>
                    <li>Call Option Example-
                        A potential homeowner sees a new development going up. That person may want the right
                        to purchase a home in the future but will only want to exercise that right after
                        certain developments around the area are built.The potential homebuyer buy a call
                        option from the developer to buy the home at say $400,000 at any point in the next
                        three years.The potential homebuyer needs to contribute a down payment to lock in that
                        right.
                        This cost is known as the premium.The deposit might be $20,000 that the buyer pays the
                        developer.
                        Let's say two years have passed, and now the developments are built and zoning has been
                        approved.
                        The homebuyer exercises the option and buys the home for $400,000 because that is the
                        contract purchased.
                        Now, in an alternate scenario, say the zoning approval doesn't come through until
                        year four. This is one year past the expiration of this option. Now the homebuyer must
                        pay the market price because the contract has expired. In either case, the developer
                        keeps the original $20,000 collected.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A put gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the
                        underlying stock at the strike price on or before expiration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the underlying price falls,the put gains value as long put is a short
                        position in the underlying security.This can be purchased as a sort of insurance etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>A buyer of put believes the stock price is going down which means the seller of
                        the put must mean the stock price is going up.
                    </li>
                    <li>Put Option Example-an investor wants insurance on their S&P 500 index portfolio,
                        they can purchase put options. An investor may fear that a bear market is near
                        and may be unwilling to lose more than 10% of their long position in the S&P 500
                        index. If the S&P 500 is currently trading at $2,500, they can purchase a put
                        option giving them the right to sell the index at $2,250, for example, at any
                        point in the next two years.If in six months the market crashes by 20% (500
                        points on the index), they have made 250 points by being able to sell the
                        index at $2,250 when it is trading at $2,000—a combined loss of just 10%.
                        In fact, even if the market drops to zero, the loss would only be 10% if
                        this put option is held.

            <h3>Options Strategies</h3>
            <h4>1) Covered Call</h4>
            <p>With calls, there is a simple strategy to buy a call in which investor sells call options
                on the open market without owning the underlying secuity.This is famous strategy as it
                generates imcome and reduces some risk of being long on the stock alone.The trade-off must
                be selling your shares at a set price- the short strike price.
            </p>
            <p>For example -Investors may choose to use this strategy when they have a short-term position
                in the stock and a neutral opinion on its direction. They might be looking to generate
                income through the sale of the call premium or protect against a potential decline
                in the underlying stock's value.
            </p>

        <section id="marriedput">
            <h4>2) Married Put</h4>
            <p>In this kind of strategy, an investor purchases an asset includes shares of stock and
                further purchases put options for an equivalent number of shares.The holder of a put
                option has the right to sell stock at the strike price and each contract is worth 100
                shares.
            </p>
            <p>An investor may choose to use this strategy as a way of protecting their downside
                risk when holding a stock. This strategy functions similarly to an insurance
                policy; it establishes a price floor in the event the stock's price falls sharply.
                This is why it's also known as a protective put.
            </p>
            <p>For example -Suppose an investor buys 100 shares of stock and buys one put option
                simultaneously. This strategy may be appealing for this investor because they are
                protected to the downside, in the event that a negative change in the stock price
                occurs. At the same time, the investor would be able to participate in every upside
                opportunity if the stock gains in value. The only disadvantage of this strategy is
                that if the stock does not fall in value, the investor loses the amount of the
                premium paid for the put option.

        <section id="bullcall">
            <h4>3) Bull Call Spread</h4>
            <p>In this kind of strategy,an investor buys calls at a specific strike price as well as
                also setting the same number of calls at a higher strike price.Both call options
                will have the same expiration date and underlying asset.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of vertical spread strategy is often used when an investor is bullish
                on the underlying asset and expects a moderate rise in the price of the asset.
                Using this strategy, the investor is able to limit their upside on the trade
                while also reducing the net premium spent

        <section id="bearput">
            <h4>4) Bear Put Spread</h4>
            <p> In this strategy, the investor simultaneously purchases put options at a specific
                strike price and also sells the same number of puts at a lower strike price.
                Both options are purchased for the same underlying asset and have the same
                expiration date.This strategy is used when the trader has a bearish sentiment
                about the underlying asset and expects the asset's price to decline.
                The strategy offers both limited losses and limited gains.
