            <div class="justi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIP – Systematic Investment Plan is a disciplined way of investing wherein 
                a fixed amount of money is invested in a pre-defined mutual fund scheme at a fixed interval. You decide the amount, the 
                SIP date and the schemes in which you wish to invest. One can plan different life goals be it such as children’s future, 
                retirement, international holiday, holiday home, etc.</div><br>
            <div class="justi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A type of investment plan provided by mutual fund providers is called a 
                Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). One can periodically (weekly, monthly, or quarterly) put a little amount into a chosen 
                mutual fund by using a SIP. SIP provides retail investors with a passive, disciplined investing strategy that can build 
                long-term wealth (using the power of compounding). The sum is invested on a regular basis (often monthly), which lessens 
                the effect of market volatility.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calculator helps you to estimate your monthly 
                SIP investment's predicted returns and wealth gain. Based on an anticipated annual return rate, you can obtain a rough 
                estimate of the maturity amount for any monthly SIP.</div>

            <h3 class="h3">Is SIP a mutual fund?</h3>
            <div class="justi">People believe that SIP is either not a mutual fund or that it is. SIP, however, is a method of investing 
                and not a fund, programme, stock, or outlet for investing. It is a means of making recurring investments in a fund or 
                plan of your choosing.
            </div>
            <h3 class="h3">What are the benefits of SIP?</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="justi">SIP fosters discipline because it allows you to invest a specific amount on a regular basis. At a predetermined 
                        interval, a fixed sum is automatically invested. To put money to work, one does not need to invest regular time.</li>
                    <li class="justi">You can start small and there is no need to have a lot of money to start a SIP. A SIP of even Rs. 500 per month 
                        is sufficient to start with. And then depending on the goals and aspirations, one can increase the amount.</li>
                    <li class="justi">You don't have to be concerned about market timing when using SIP. Just continue to invest regardless of the 
                        state of the market. You obtain more units as a result when the price is low and fewer units as a result of 
                        doing this when the price is high. This ultimately results in a declining average cost per unit over time, 
                        also known as dollar cost averaging.</li>
                    <li class="justi">Take advantage of the power of compounding by using a SIP to invest money over a longer period of time. As your 
                        investment grows in value over time, the principal is increased as well, which leads to an increase in returns. 
                        The repetition of this process results in a large corpus. The magic of compounding operates in this manner.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="h3" id="space">SIP should be started when the markets are high and should be stopped when the markets fall. Is that true?</h3>
            <div class="justi">Absolutely not, and the majority of investors really end up doing this. Nobody can actually forecast whether 
                the markets will go up or down. Since SIP offers rupee-cost averaging, it shouldn't matter if the markets are rising or 
                falling. Remaining involved is the most crucial thing to keep in mind. This raises the likelihood of accruing riches over 
                time.
